# Applies this repository's fix to YOUR OWN locally-downloaded copy of the mod
# zip. No mod files are distributed here - this edits the copy you already
# have (a backup is created next to it first).
#
# Usage (from the repo root, in PowerShell):
#   .\tools\Apply-Patch.ps1
#   .\tools\Apply-Patch.ps1 -ZipPath "D:\path\to\FS25_aiTracks.zip"
#
# The patch only applies to the exact mod version it was written for; on any
# other version the script stops without changing anything.
